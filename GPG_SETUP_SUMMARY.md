# GPG Signing Setup Summary

## Overview
Successfully configured GPG signing for Maven Central publishing in this Kotlin Multiplatform project using the vanniktech Maven publish plugin.

## Configuration

### Files Modified
1. **local.properties** - Contains Maven Central credentials and GPG configuration
2. **gpg_key_content** - Contains the full ASCII-armored GPG private key
3. **library/build.gradle.kts** - Updated to read GPG key from external file

### GPG Configuration
- **GPG Key ID**: `7097995E`
- **GPG Key Password**: Empty (no password)
- **GPG Key Location**: `gpg_key_content` file in project root

### local.properties Configuration
```properties
# Maven Central credentials
mavenCentralUsername=J4Rk3ruE
mavenCentralPassword=spMIDqmykNmFad+FTVMxEUVw0R8kFDAknaUimLc+Wp10

# GPG signing (for vanniktech plugin)
signingInMemoryKeyId=7097995E
signingInMemoryKeyPassword=
# Read GPG key from file instead of inline
signingInMemoryKeyFile=gpg_key_content
```

### Build Configuration
The build script (`library/build.gradle.kts`) now automatically:
1. Reads the `signingInMemoryKeyFile` property from `local.properties`
2. Loads the GPG key content from the specified file
3. Sets it as the `signingInMemoryKey` property for the vanniktech plugin

## Usage

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test local Maven publishing
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

# Test specific publication signing
./gradlew :library:signAndroidReleasePublication
./gradlew :library:signJvmPublication
./gradlew :library:signKotlinMultiplatformPublication
```

### Maven Central Publishing
```bash
# Publish to Maven Central
./gradlew :library:publishToMavenCentral
```

## Security Notes
- The `gpg_key_content` file contains the private GPG key and should be kept secure
- This file is not committed to version control
- For CI/CD, the GPG key should be provided as an environment variable or secret

## CI/CD Configuration
For GitHub Actions or other CI/CD systems, you'll need to:
1. Store the GPG key as a secret (base64 encoded or as-is)
2. Create the `gpg_key_content` file during the CI build
3. Ensure the `local.properties` file is created with the correct credentials

## Verification
✅ GPG key is properly loaded from file
✅ All publication signing tasks work correctly
✅ Local Maven publishing works
✅ Configuration is ready for CI/CD deployment

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter signing issues:
1. Verify the GPG key is valid: `gpg --list-secret-keys`
2. Check the key format in `gpg_key_content`
3. Ensure the key ID matches the one in `local.properties`
4. Make sure the key password is correct (empty in this case)

## Next Steps
1. Test the full Maven Central publishing process
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline with proper secret management
3. Create a release and verify the artifacts are properly signed
